<h1>YepNope.js</h1>
<p>YepNope used to be supported.  It is not supported any longer, as the package itself has been depreciated.  If anyone wants to make it work with the new version, I'd be happy to post it here.</p>
<p>Documentation at the time of last working is available in the <a href="https://github.com/jtsage/jquery-mobile-datebox/commit/37d1b38c7a5caa2504d62c7a58821cbdfc121c2e">GitHub Archive</a></p>

<h1>Ruby on Rails</h1>
<p>There is a gem created by Guidecase available on <a href="https://github.com/Guidecase/jquery_mobile_datebox-rails">GitHub</a></p>

<h1>require.js / backbone.js</h1>
<p>Operation with this pair of packages is supported.  Please take a look at the <a href="3rd/backbonerequire/">demo</a>.</p>
